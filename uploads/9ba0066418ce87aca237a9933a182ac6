	<p>
	Learning a new language can be exciting at first, but after the initial novelty wears off it can be difficult to stay motivated. Sometimes work, family, and other obligations make it hard to focus on verb conjugation.

	<p>
	I'm trying to think of learning another language as a journey to a far off place. I have a rough map and a few supplies. Maybe I'll find some interesting places along the way or pick up more supplies. Perhaps I'll add another member to my party. Maybe I played too many text adventures as a child.

        <li>A Duolingo account</li>
        <li>Practicing writing at Lang-8</li>
        <li>Scraps of what I remember from college</li>
